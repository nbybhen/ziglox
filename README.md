# Ziglox

Implementation of clox, a compiler written by [Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/a-bytecode-virtual-machine.html) for the Lox language, with [Jaran Chao](https://github.com/JarnaChao09). Check out their repository [here](https://github.com/JarnaChao09/ZigLox).

The primary purpose(s) of this project is to both get an understanding of how compilers work and are implemented, as well as learn and improve my ability to write programs using Zig.
